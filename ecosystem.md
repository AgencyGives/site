# Ecosystem Deployments

<br>JusticeDAO will be deploying itself and its financial products across many chains, some chains will provide more anonymity for justice seeking movements.<br/>

<br>JusticeDAO will initially launch as a [1hive garden](https://gardens.1hive.org/#/home). The public nature of the ethereum blockchain means that the grants given out by this initial deployment of JusticeDAO must not be capable of putting DAO members or Grant Recipients at risk.<br/>

<br>We are also deploying on [oasis](https://oasisprotocol.org/) [agoric](https://agoric.com), [holochain](https://www.holochain.org/), [aleo](https://www.aleo.org/), [aztec](https://aztec.network/), and [mina](https://minaprotocol.com/).<br/>
